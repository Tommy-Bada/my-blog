        My Two-Year Goal: Bridging the Gap from Front-End to Full-Stack Mastery
      </h1>
      <p>
        Documenting my growth has been a significant part of my journey in the
        tech world. Each year, I take the time to reflect on my achievements,
        challenges, and lessons learned, hoping that in a few years, the pieces
        will fit together to form a coherent narrative of progress. This is my
        third year into this practice, and the question of where I see myself in
        the next two years feels particularly timely. It positions me at a
        unique intersection between how far I've come and the exciting future I
        envision.
      </p>
      <p>
        The past few years have been transformative. From initially grappling
        with the basics of front-end development to becoming proficient in
        creating user interfaces that are both visually appealing and
        functionally robust, the journey has been both challenging and
        rewarding. Along the way, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        and frameworks like React and Angular. I've worked on projects that
        taught me the importance of user experience, accessibility, and
        performance optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now, my expertise lies primarily in front-end development. I've
        become adept at translating design mockups into responsive, interactive
        web applications. My code is cleaner, my understanding of best practices
        deeper, and my ability to debug and optimize has grown significantly.
        However, I recognize that the tech industry is evolving rapidly, and
        staying confined to the front end limits my potential impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next two years, I aim to transition from a front-end developer to
        a full-stack developer. This means not only solidifying my existing
        skills but also acquiring new ones. The first step in this journey will
        be to dive deep into back-end technologies. I plan to start with Node.js
        and Express for server-side development and gradually move on to
        databases like MongoDB and SQL. Understanding how to design and manage
        databases, implement server-side logic, and handle API requests will be
        crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my most ambitious goals is to have spearheaded or contributed to
        products used by at least a million people. This goal is not just about
        the numbers but the value and impact my work can create. Whether it's an
        innovative web application, a helpful tool, or a contribution to a
        large-scale project, I want my work to be meaningful and widely
        recognized.
      </p>
      <p>
        The journey to becoming a full-stack developer is challenging but
        exciting. It requires dedication, continuous learning, and a passion for
        building valuable products. In two years, I envision myself as a
        versatile developer who can handle any part of the development process,
        contribute significantly to impactful projects, and continuously push
        the boundaries of what's possible. Documenting this journey will not
        only keep me accountable but also serve as a source of inspiration for
        others embarking on a similar path.
